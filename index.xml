      <description>Launch Longhorn v1.0.1. Launch a pod with Longhorn volume. Write data to the volume and take the 1st backup. Create 2 DR volumes from the 1st backup. Shutdown the pod and wait for the original volume detached. Expand the original volume and wait for the expansion complete. Write data to the original volume and take the 2nd backup. (Make sure the total data size is larger than the original volume size so that there is date written to the expanded part.</description>

      <description>This one is a special case, were the volume only contains 1 backup, which the user requests to delete while the user has another backup in progress. In this case, as the another backup is in progress a lock mechanism will be applied to it and blocks the deletion of the backup.
 create vol dak and attach to the same node vol bak is attached connect to node via ssh and issue dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/longhorn/dak status=progress wait for a bunch of data to be written (1GB) take a backup(1) wait for a bunch of data to be written (1GB) take a backup(2) immediately request deletion of backup(1) verify that backup(2) completes successfully.</description>

      <description>Set up a node with CentOS and make sure that the output of sestatus indicates that SELinux is enabled and set to Enforcing. Run the k3s installation script. Install Longhorn. The system should come up successfully. The logs of the Engine Image pod should only say installed, and the system should be able to deploy a Volume successfully from the UI.  Note: There appears to be some problems with running k3s on CentOS, presumably due to the firewalld rules.</description>

      <description>Notice that the behaviors will be different if the cluster node roles are different. e.g., A cluster contains 1 dedicated master node + 3 worker node is different from a cluster contains 3 nodes which are both master and worker. This test may need to be validated for both kind of cluster.
 Install Longhorn system. Deploy one more compatible engine image. Deploy some workloads using Longhorn volumes then write some data.</description>

      <description>Setup  2 attached volumes with data. 2 detached volumes with data. 2 new volumes without data. 2 deployments of one pod. 1 statefulset of 10 pods. Auto Salvage set to disable.  Test After upgrade:
 Make sure the existing instance managers didn&amp;rsquo;t restart. Make sure pods didn&amp;rsquo;t restart. Check the contents of the volumes. If the Engine API version is incompatible, manager cannot do anything about the attached volumes except detaching it.</description>

Additionally, check the Setting page and make sure that the &amp;ldquo;Default Data Path&amp;rdquo; setting has been set to /var/lib/rancher/longhorn/ by default. Now, change the &amp;ldquo;Default Data Path&amp;rdquo; setting to something else, such as /home, and save the new settings.

      <description>Since the client falling back to NFSv3 usually results in a failure to mount the NFS share, the way we can check for NFSv3 fallback is to check the error message returned and see if it mentions rpc.statd, since dependencies on rpc.statd and other services are no longer needed for NFSv4, but are needed for NFSv3. The NFS mount should not fall back to NFSv3 and instead only give the user a warning that the server may be NFSv3:</description>

Case 1:  Disable the setting auto-salvage. Create and attach a volume. Keep writing data to the volume. Disconnect the node that the volume attached to for 100 seconds during the data writing. Wait for the node back. The volume will be detached then reattached automatically. And there are some replicas still running after the reattachment.  Case 2:  Launch Longhorn. Launch a pod with the volume and write some data.</description>

      <description>Stability of uninstallation   Launch Longhorn system.
  Use scripts to continuously create then delete multiple DaemonSets.
 e.g., putting the following python test into the manager integration test directory and run it:  from common import get_apps_api_client # NOQA def test_uninstall_script(): apps_api = get_apps_api_client() while True: for i in range(10): name = &amp;quot;ds-&amp;quot; + str(i) try: ds = apps_api.read_namespaced_daemon_set(name, &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;) if ds.status.number_ready == ds.status.number_ready: apps_api.delete_namespaced_daemon_set(name, &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;) except Exception: apps_api.</description>

Fail if: The upgrading is blocked after about 17-20 managers are up.
Note: This is a race condition, so we need to try multiple times to validate the fix.</description>

      <guid>https://longhorn.github.io/longhorn-tests/manual/release-specific/v1.0.1/ui-volume-deletion/</guid>
      <description>A number of cases need to be manually tested in longhorn-ui. To test these cases, create the Volume with the specified conditions in each case, and then try to delete it. What is observed should match what is described in the test case:
 A regular Volume. Only the default deletion prompt should show up asking to confirm deletion. A Volume with a Persistent Volume. The deletion prompt should tell the user that there is a Persistent Volume that will be deleted along with the Volume.</description>
