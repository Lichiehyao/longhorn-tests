      <description> Create and attach a volume. Deploy an extra engine image. Send live upgrade request then immediately delete the related engine manager pod/engine process (The new replicas are not in active in this case). Verify the volume will detach then reattach automatically. Verify the upgrade is done during the reattachment. (It actually becomes offline upgrade.)  </description>

      <description>New installation:  create a large cluster of many nodes (about 30 nodes) Install Longhorn master  Upgrading from old version:  create a large cluster of many nodes (about 30 nodes) Install Longhorn v1.0.0 Upgrade Longhorn to master  Success if: install/upgrade successfully after maximum 15 minutes.
Fail if: The upgrading is blocked after about 17-20 managers are up.
Note: This is a race condition, so we need to try multiple times to validate the fix.</description>
